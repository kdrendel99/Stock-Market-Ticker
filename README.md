## Improvement Opportunities 

* Form validation isn't robust. This warrants potential for injections, poor input sanitization, and a potentially rocky/error-prone user experience when considering scalability.
* Refactor to use React Bootstrap for component-based building.
* Replace loading spinner in form submission with a modal to communicate more clearly the submission has been made.
* Refactor to use TypeScript for build in prop-typing/type checking.
* Add dropdown menu in navbar for better user experience.
* Change 'quote-overview' route to private route to prevent navigation unless user has already received a quote.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
#### Open Locally
- Open terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/kdrendel99/Stock-Market-Ticker.git` to clone the project into your desired directory.

After cloning the repository locally, navigate into the root project directory (Stock-Market-Ticker). 
Install the application's dependencies before compiling by running:
#### `npm install`

#### Compiling

When finished, run the application in development mode with:

#### `npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the compiled application in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.



You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`

  
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  


### `npm run build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

This will correctly bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

  

See the React documentation about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  

### `npm run eject`

  

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

  

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

  

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
